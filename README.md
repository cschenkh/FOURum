# FOURum
I don't fully know where I want to go with this app / project as of right now,
but so far as I know, I mostly want to learn the dynamic web programming that
goes into building a submission based web page.
## Milestones
- Display a webpage that can display text
- Add growable modules that can be repeated to display a dynamic number of posts (from files?)
- Connect to database (non-relational?) to get display content
- Add depth to webpage so that there are self-contained modules of separate documents
## Technologies Used
- Web Server (Apache?)
- Database (SQL?)
## Currently TODO:
- Everything :)
	- Try out Web Servers and which one would be best
	- Will probably need to serve up PHP / Python / JS
	- Look into non-relational databases
	- Finish TODO list
## Completed:
- Picked a name? (remove)
## Bugs / Misc Unplanned Features:
- Nobody can say anything bad about my forum if it doesn't exist!
